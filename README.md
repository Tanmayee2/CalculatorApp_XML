# Calculator App(XML)

A basic and minimalistic calculator app with Addition, Subtraction, 
Multiplication, Division and Percentage functionalities.
This app uses XML to define the UI Layout.
The guidlines have been followed accordingly:
- The top is a textview and occupies twice the space as the other rows (in terms of height).
- Top textview has textAlignment set to “textEnd”, textSize as 80sp, and textStyle is “bold”
- The “0” button occupies twice the space as other buttons (in terms of width).
- Every component has a margin of 2dp and a text size of 30 sp (except the top textView).

## Functionality

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User sees a basic calculator with +, -, x, /, operators
* [ ] User can perform the mentioned operations.
* [ ] User can clear the display with 'C'.
* [ ] User can add decimal point.
* [ ] User can perform percentage operation.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The only challenge I faced was adjusting the shape of buttons which was originally round. 
I used a drawable resource to deal with this. I couldn't use ConstraintLayout for the same
because I was following a TableLayout.
